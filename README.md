> Get system log from macOS much easier for debugging

macOS Sierra introduced a new mechanism for both application and system level logging.
Thus we can no longer get system.log from /var/log/system.log.
Which made developer's debugging life further from innocence.
That's why I started this project to just simply log all of system.log to console.
More functionality will be added later, if you have a good idea for this project, don't hesitate to make a pull request for me :)

I wait for you. Wish you all enjoy this tiny but useful program.

Install
-------
- Download binary executable program [here](https://github.com/syscl/maclog/files/692460/maclog-v1.2.zip).
- Double left click to execute it (Note: for first time launch: ```Right Click â–¶ Open```)

If you want to compile it, follow these step in a terminal window:
- Download the latest source code by entering the following command:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/syscl/maclog
```
- Change to project directory:
```sh
cd maclog
```
- Build the project:
```sh
clang src/*.c -Os -Iinclude -fobjc-arc -fmodules -mmacosx-version-min=10.6 -o maclog
```
- Or if you have Xcode installed:
```sh
xcodebuild
```

Usage
-----
### CLI
```
USAGE: maclog [--version|-v] [--help|-h]
USAGE: maclog [log mode] [filter]
```

#### Arguments:
  - `--help`, `-h`: Show maclog help info.
  - `--version`, `-v`: Show maclog version info.
  - Log Modes:
    - `--boot`, `-b`: Show log messages since last boot time.
    - `--darkWake`, `-d`: Show log messages since last darkWake time.
    - `--sleep`, `-s`: Show log messages since last sleep time.
    - `--stream`, `-S`: Show log messages in real time.
    - `--wake`, `-w`: Show log messages since last wake time.
  - Filter:
    - `--filter`, `-f`: Show log messages filtered by the <query>.
    - `--filterMessage`, `-F`: Shorthand for `-f "eventMessage CONTAINS[c] <query>"`

*__NOTE__: The default behaviour is to show all log messages of the current day.*

*__NOTE__: The messages returned by `--boot`, `--sleep`, `--wake`, `--darkWake` can be from previous days, depending on the last time each action occurred.*

*__NOTE__: The `--filter` option can be used with any other above arguments. This can be handy for sorting out certain logs.*
